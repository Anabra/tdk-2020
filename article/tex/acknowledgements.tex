	I would like to thank Csaba Hruska, my external advisor who not only provided me with the opportunity to work on this project, but also mentored me throughout the entirity of it. I would also like thank Andor Pénzes, the other founding member of the GRIN project\footnote{More precisely the modernized GRIN project, since it was Urban Boquist who developed the original framework~\cite{boquist-phd}}, who together with Csaba poured countless hours of engineering effort into the design and implementation of the modernized compiler.
	
	Furthermore, I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my family who helped and supported me during my university studies, and made this thesis possible.
	
	Finally, I would like to say special thanks to István Bozó, Gábor Páli and Ambrus Kaposi who introduced me to the world of functional programming.
